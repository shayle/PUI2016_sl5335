For this assignment, I received help from Kristi, Ian W., Danny, Avikal and Geoff for assignment 1 regarding how to best plot the line in log space and then implementing the chi square test after wrangling the data on my own. I then helped pass that knowledge along to Maisha. 

For assignment 2, I noticed a small error in my original data wrangling after looking into why the visualization did not seem to reflect the numerical results. The results were actually very different from what was originally reviewed and, sadly, insignificant.

the analsyis is fine 9and it is ok that you have a null result!0 but you have no figures, no equations for tyour test or your H0/Ha etc in the notebook! A scientific report, however short, must describe and show the data (table or figure). The Ha and H0 should be stated in words and in formulae. Ideally the formula for the test if easy enough should be included etc.
I recommand you read some scientific literature!
