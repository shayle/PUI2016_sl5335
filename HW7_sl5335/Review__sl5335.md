Clarity: As the title implies the plot supposed to visualize total deadlifting volume in 2016 where X-axis represents date in yyyy/mm/dd
format and Y-axis represents total weight in pounds. The plot has attributes such as title, axes caption, legend, and readable color scheme. 
In my opinion, it's clear how to read this plot. For example, on March 20th, 2016, in 11 sets total weight was more than 5000 pounds.

Esthetic: Color scheme is readable. Graphic elements are appropriate to represent the quantities.

Honesty: The plot reproduces the data correctly.

Suggestion: get rid of the time in 0's on x-axis and split the y-axis to 500s in order to read results easily.
