    "Overall the plot looks great and you defintely are used some innovative ways of graphing out your stiry.  There's a good amount of detail to look into also.  There's a bit of a downside to that though.  I think can look a little dense. I would suggest breaking out the plot in separate ones or perhaps use wider bars to cover more space which might thereby give the chart a bit more room to breathe.  And since there a lot of granularity, I would also try using more subdued colors so the right things pop.\n",
